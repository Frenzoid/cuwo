CubeWorld server for docker.
==================

* * *
HOW TO LAUNCH
---

Just create a container with the image and expose the port 12345 on the host to whatever port you want (12345 too recomended) and start it.

* * *
ENV VARS
----
- ADMINPASSWORD: A password for the admin. (By default its "admin" so make sure to change this).
- MOTD: The welcome message of the server.
- SEED: The seed of the map generator  (Default value: 26879).
- MAXPLAYERS: The value of the amount of users that can be on the server at the same time. (Default is 10)
- MAXCONNPERIP: The value of the maxmium amount of connections per ip. (Default is 4)
- UPDATE: By default false, if true, it'll execute the update.sh, once updated, it will start the server automatically.

* * *
EDITING PERMISSIONS AND STUFF
---
If you want to edit the permissions (to have more than an admin rank, lets say, helpers, moderators and admins) you'll need to login via interactive tty, edit the files with ```nano```, the files are at  ```/XENIUM/CubeWorld```, save them, and reboot the docker container.

For more info  about  how to do this, i would recommend to check the [cuwo docs](https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki) and [official page](http://cuwo.org/).
