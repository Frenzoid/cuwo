CubeWorld server for docker.
==================

* * *
HOW TO LAUNCH
---

Just create a container with the image and expose the port 12345 on the host to whatever port you want (12345 too recomended) and start it.

* * *
ENV VARS
----
- ADMINPASSWORD: A password for the admin. (By default its "admin" so make sure to change this).
- MOTD: The welcome message of the server.
- SEED: The seed of the map generator  (Default value: 26879).
- MAXPLAYERS: The value of the amount of users that can be on the server at the same time. (Default is 10)
- MAXCONNPERIP: The value of the maxmium amount of connections per ip. (Default is 4)
- UPDATE: By default false, if true, it'll execute the update.sh, once updated, it will start the server automatically.

* * *
EDITING PERMISSIONS AND STUFF
---
If you want to edit the permissions (to have more than an admin rank, lets say, helpers, moderators and admins) you'll need to login via interactive tty, edit the files with ```nano```, the files are at  ```/XENIUM/CubeWorld```, save them, and reboot the docker container.

For more info  about  how to do this, i would recommend to check the [cuwo docs](https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki) and [official page](http://cuwo.org/).

COMMANDS AND ADMIN COMMANDS
---
- Here my boy: [command list](https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki/Commands)
- Quick one: to login as admin just type ```/login [YOUR ENV ADMINPASSWORD VALUE]```

====

cuwo is an open server implementation for Cube World, written in Python and
C++. It currently has the best protocol coverage among all the server projects
out there, and has features like

* Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, what have you)
* NPCs and mobs, just as in the regular server
* File/console logging
* MOTD message
* Scripting (see the minimal welcome.py example)
* Advanced configuration
* Ban system
* Commands (/kick, /say, /whereis, /setclock, /kill, /stun. etc.)
* Rights management (/login password)
* IRC bot
* PvP script
* DDoS prevention
* Lower CPU requirements than normal server
* Optimizations in C++
* Master server on http://cuwo.org
* Support for 40+ players
* ... and much more!

Note that cuwo only supports x86 and x86-64, so it will not work on ARM.

Running
=======

Windows
-------

See the
[quick-start guide](https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki/Quickstart) for a
quick way to get started.

Alternatively, you can also
[build from source](https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki/WindowsSource).

Source
------

Make sure you have Python >= 3.6, native compilers, and the following
dependencies installed:

* `cython`
* `pyrr`

If you want IRC bot support, you will also need the `irc3` package.

These packages can be installed with `pip install cython pyrr irc3`

To build cuwo, run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.

To run the server, run `python -m cuwo.server`.

For more information, see
[this guide](https://github.com/matpow2/cuwo/wiki/BuildSource).

Status
======

In terms of the protocol and features, the following has been implemented:
* Player join/leave
* Player movement and animations
* Magic/arrows/etc. relay
* Player hits on entities/other players
* Item pickup/drop
* Time management
* Terrain generator
* Interactive objects (doors, beds)
* Preliminary support for Mobs and NPCs

A lot is still to be implemented gameplay-wise. Most importantly, NPCs and mobs
have only recently been implemented, so expect some issues related to these.

Other features include
* MITM proxy (for reverse-engineering)
* Cube World/Qubicle model converter (tools/convertqmo.py)
* Map viewer (tools/mapviewer.py)

FAQ
===

* **Q.** I get `ImportError: No module named 'cuwo.entity'` when running cuwo.

* **A.** See the instructions for running/building cuwo.

* **Q.** How do I pronounce 'cuwo'?

* **A.** 'coo-woo' (no, not 'kew-woh')

* **Q.** I am not a programmer, and I can't reverse-engineer anything. How do
         I help?

* **A.** We need people who can create end-user documentation as well! Have a
         look around, and see if anything is missing on the wiki.

* **Q.** What is a MITM proxy?

* **A.** A MITM proxy sits between your client and server, and can manipulate
         and inject packets. It's not really useful to the normal user, so
         use the regular cuwo server instead.
